## Theory Primer

### MLOps System View
- Treat the ML service as a socio-technical system: data → features → model → service → feedback → governance.
- Separate concerns: data quality, model quality, service reliability, and human processes (approvals/audits).
- Favor reproducibility: fixed seeds, pinned data versions, deterministic preprocessing, and logged metadata.

### Data and Features
- Data generating process matters: drift can stem from sensor changes, policy shifts, or seasonality.
- Guard against leakage: keep temporal and entity splits strict; avoid using post-outcome signals.
- Feature scaling/encoding choices influence stability; track schema and units to avoid silent breaks.

### Evaluation Theory
- Bias–variance–noise: choose model capacity and regularization to balance fit and generalization.
- Metrics: RMSE/MAE for magnitude error, R² for explained variance, MAPE for relative error; segment metrics to catch localized failures.
- Uncertainty: prefer prediction intervals or quantile models when decisions are sensitive to tails.

### Monitoring and Drift
- Data drift: shifts in $P(X)$; detect via KS/PSI and schema checks. Concept drift: shifts in $P(Y|X)$; detect via residual trends.
- SLOs: define latency, availability, and quality thresholds; align alerts to actions (retrain vs rollback).
- Freshness: track model and data age; stale models often degrade before errors spike.

### CI/CD and Deployment
- Immutable artifacts: build once, promote by tag; keep N−1 for rollback.
- Staged promotion: dev → staging → prod; require automated gates (tests, eval) before promotion.
- Canary/blue-green reduce blast radius; observe metrics before full rollout.

### Retraining and Redeployment
- Triggers: drift, performance regression, scheduled cadence, or business events.
- Retraining loop: pull data, train, evaluate, compare to incumbent, document, and promote only with evidence.
- Always validate in staging with the exact image/model intended for prod.

### Governance and Risk
- Fairness: monitor parity across key slices; check both distributional and error parity.
- Documentation: keep Model Card, Data Card, and audit trail updated per promotion.
- Security: protect secrets, validate inputs, and audit dependencies.

### Observability and Alerting
- Metrics: latency/error rate, throughput, drift counts, and quality KPIs.
- Logs: include model/version, request IDs, and minimal input metadata (respect privacy).
- Alerts must be actionable; define runbooks for each class (drift, SLO breach, pipeline failure).

### Reproducibility and Experimentation
- Track code SHA, data hash (DVC), hyperparams, seeds, and environment (Python/package versions).
- Use consistent splits and seeds across experiments; prefer deterministic preprocessing pipelines.

### Safety and Rollback
- Keep rollback playbooks; rehearse rollbacks in staging.
- Avoid irreversible actions during deploy; validate health and a sample prediction before declaring success.

   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 gcr.io/ml-pipeline/api-server:2.0.5

3️⃣  Skip deployment (pipeline is already validated):
   - pm25_pipeline.yaml is ready for production
================================================================================
```
